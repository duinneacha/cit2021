        <p>Prior to visiting Ali, I had been on prescribed tablets for severe acid reflux for over 15 years with little improvement. After speaking with Ali and implementing her diet plan including vitamins, led to no more tablets and more importantly, no more reflux.</p>
        <p>Eating new healthier foods has resulted in the loss of excess weight with no ill effects, increased energy levels and better sleep.</p>

        <p>In January 2019 I weighed in at 124KG. I was facing into my first Masters European powerlifting competition for the IPF representing Ireland in March. I needed to be below 120KG which I just about managed. After the competition I decided it was time to review my lifestyle.  At 5’9” and 47 years old I was getting concerned about my general health especially with a family history of cardiac issues, a recent blood test had shown I was pre diabetic and A hernia which had been a long term, non-symptomatic issue decided to flare up and required surgery. Advice from the surgeon was also to lose weight.</p>
        <p>My goal was to get under 93 KG and represent Ireland at the next Masters Europeans in March 2020. I was concerned that I would not be able to manage this myself as I had struggled with weight loss previously and thought I needed to be accountable to someone else to achieve this goal. I was also very conscious that this amount of weight loss would significantly impact my strength. It was with this in mind and knowing Ali’s background I took the decision to seek her help. It was not easy, especially initially, but once I got used to the new meal plan, and portion sizes the journey was relatively easy. I achieved both goals of hitting under 93KG and representing Ireland again (With 3 days to spare before lockdown!). My blood sugar was normal and I was sleeping better.
</p>
        <p>The service from Ali was honest, straight forward, clear and objective with measurements affirming what I knew was happening with body fat %. The focus from Ali was not just on my weight loss but also my general health. The meal plans were tailored to my needs, tastes and ability in the kitchen. The main issue was the time meal and snack prep took, but once I got used to that it just became part of my day. I would happily recommend Ali to any strength athletes, or anyone else, who were looking to become a bit less fluffy!</p>

        <p>I went to Ali after I was diagnosed with Non-alcohol Fatty Liver disease and high cholesterol. I had not been feeling myself for months before going to Ali. What struck me from my first appointment was how knowledgeable Ali was! My treatment was so specific to me and easy to follow. Ali’s support and guidance were very reassuring throughout. In a few short months under Ali’s guidance I was able to reverse my Fatty Liver diagnosis and reduce my cholesterol. I have energy now that I haven’t had in years and I can honestly say I feel 10 years younger. I cannot recommend Ali highly enough. </p>

        <p>Ali saved my life – a bold statement but a true statement! I went to Ali with the goal to improve my sports performance. I felt when I was training mentally I could give more physically I couldn’t. I purely put this down to my nutrition. Sitting down with Ali she unveiled a lot more as to why I wasn’t able to reach these sport goals. I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis in 2017, an autoimmune disease only managed with medication. Well that’s what I was told.</p>

        <p>Since my diagnosis, I’ve been on numerous different medications and steroids yet I have never been in remission. Side effects of the condition meant I would easily fatigue, have digestion issues, bloating, cramping and generally feeling uncomfortable in my own body. I was told my consultant I had no choice to go on my more intense medication. This meant I would be completely immune supprassed and  I would have to cocoon. There was a high  risk of increasing my likelihood of osteoporosis, cancers and likely to have complications if I was to get pregnant. None of which sounded appealing to a young active women!</p>
        <p>Ali has  been the only person to listen to me! She took on board everything I said about my Ulcerative Colitis and my toying decision of life altering medication. Ali gave me a lifeline. She made it simple didn’t over complicate it.  She told me we had to regenerate my gut health. Over period of 3-4 months I was put on holistic medication to help strengthen my gut wall.</p>
        <p>I am now in remission – first time ever since my diagnosis!  Working with Ali I achieved more than expected from my sports goals to managing my Ulcerative colitis though a holistic approach. Ali couldn’t have done enough for me she went over and above. The experience I’ve had working with Ali has surpassed my experiences being mismanaged through western medicine. Ali is amazing person, so knowledgeable in her field of nutrition, she approachable and ever great mentor. I could highly recommend Ali to anyone!!</p>
