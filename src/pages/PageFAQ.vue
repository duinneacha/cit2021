              Dry needling is a technique using acupuncture needles in the area of a trigger point within a muscle. The trigger points are little nodules in taut bands of muscle. Taut bands shorten the muscle inhibiting muscle function. Dry needling releases the taut bands and reduces the pain caused by Trigger Points. Dry needling is more specific than trigger point therapy and is very effective with chronic active trigger points. The client will feel a localised twitch response then the dry needle activates the nodule, and this is the process engaging the nervous system to relax the affected area.

              Please wear comfortable loose-fitting clothing for your appointment so you are comfortable and can do any exercises demonstrated. Avoid wearing jeans, belts, sports tops, tight pants and dresses. It is recommended that you wear shorts and t shirt, tracksuit bottoms, a bra for ladies so that the therapist can access back muscles if needed in the session (sports tops are hard to work through), runners if you have a foot injury that needs assessing, slacks or light pants will do to

              <p>Ali works with people to make long term health changes, this takes time, support and ongoing accountability.

              <p>This includes 3x 1hr sessions over 3 months with ongoing support and check ins.  You will be given an action plan, supplement recommendations and meal recommendations. You may also be recommended to undergo some health tests. Health tests if required are an additional cost by the lab.</p>

              <p class="text-bold">Follow up sessions for long term clients</p>
              <p>Follow up sessions for long term clients that are on a current plan are €50 per session. If a new meal plan is needed it will be €100.</p>
              <p>Interpretation and recommendation of health tests for ongoing clients is €50 for the interpretation and appointment to go through the recommendations.</p>
